# Max-Luke-CI-CD-Pipeline
DevOps Final Project 2022
# Overview
This project is centered around using both Continuous Integration as well as Continuous Deployment to run tests on pull requests to make sure our code is always in a running state.
# Setup
For setup there are three main things that we need to do:
1. Create a sample program to run and create tests for it by using Flask.
2. Create an AWS EC2 instance to host our program.
3. Create a CI/CD yml file to have continuous integration and continuous deployment.
